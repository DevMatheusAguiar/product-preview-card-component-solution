My Process:

Built With Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, Flexbox, VSCode - Code editor, Google Fonts - Font library. 

What I Learned Throughout this project: I often introduced fixes that later caused other issues, like setting an image width to 114% or creating a class just for button centering. However, as I refined the project, I tackled these challenges step by step, learning the importance of iterative problem-solving in frontend development.

Continued Development: My plans revolve around developing systems that run on browsers, expanding my horizons in web-based applications and keeping up with the ever-evolving standards and best practices.

Useful Resources ChatGPT - It helped me address some of the queries that came up during the development process.
